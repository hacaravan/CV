I'm a Junior Full Stack Developer, looking to help improve your organisation! My first coding experience came while working as a Pricing Analyst for an ethical energy company, and since then I've sought out opportunities to develop my skills further. I picked out the intense Makers Academy software development bootcamp, where I've dedicated the last few months to learning new skills and the best ways to code. Now that I've graduated, I'm excited to put what I've learnt to the test in the world of work, and keep building on it!  

From my early days of VBA and SQL, through to building mobile apps using React Native, I've always enjoyed the challenge of picking up new technologies. I've worked extensively with SQL, Ruby and Javascript, including Rails, React Native and Node.js, as well as HTML, CSS and numerous testing frameworks. I'm focused on coding and working the right way, which in my eyes means OOP, comprehensive testing, version control with git & GitHub, collaborative working and supporting your peers.

## Strengths

#### Fast & Enthusiastic Learner

I love learning new things - whether it be practical skills, information or random trivia. As soon as I learn something I want to put it into practice or share the information with someone.  
At Makers, I immersed myself in learning, picking up numerous technologies and approaches from scratch, constantly testing my learning with projects, and making sure I kept a learning log of all the most important things I worked on.  
When I worked at Bristol Energy, I went into the role not even knowing how Excel worked properly, but I soon picked them up and regularly offered support to my colleagues with Excel, VBA and SQL.

#### Logical Problem Solver

When encountering a problem - from small error messages to more complex interactions - I always try to approach it as logically as possible, to work out _how_ to solve it before diving into it. By thinking about _why_ something is or isn't working, I'm able to narrow down a larger problem to a much more specific one. This was noted in one of the external reviews I did while a Makers student, where the reviewer said:
>You did a really good job with being able to read the important information in the backtrace and were able to identify where errors were occurring and what kind of error it was, this meant that for the most part you could interpret what the problem was by using that information and you did not try random changes to the code in order to fix the bugs.
