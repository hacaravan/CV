I'm a Junior Full Stack Developer, looking to help improve your organisation! I was  first introduced to the world of coding while working as a Pricing Analyst for an ethical energy company, and since then I've sought out opportunities to develop my skills further. I picked out the intense Makers Academy software development bootcamp, where I've dedicated the last few months to learning new skills and the best ways to code. Now that I've graduated, I'm excited to put what I've learnt to the test in the world of work, and keep building on it!  

From my early days of VBA and SQL, through to building mobile apps using React Native, I've always enjoyed the challenge of picking up new technologies. I've worked extensively with Ruby and Javascript, Rails, React Native, Node.js and numerous testing frameworks. I'm focused on coding and working the right way, which in my eyes means OOP, comprehensive testing, version control with git & GitHub, collaborative working and supporting your peers.

## Experience

**Makers Academy** (January - March 2021)  
_Software Development Bootcamp_

- Collaborative working through multiple group & pair projects to produce clean, reusable code
- Javascript & Ruby, including React Native, Node.js, jQuery and Rails
- Self-led, language-agnostic learning
- Relational (PostgreSQL) and non-relational (MongoDB) databases
- TDD using several testing frameworks - Jasmine, Jest, RSpec, Sinatra, Capybara
- OOP, RESTful routing, agile working and other best practices
- Emotional Intelligence curriculum - communication, feedback, self-awareness, empathy

**Bristol Energy** (March 2017 - October 2020)  
_Pricing Analyst/Senior Pricing Analyst_

- Working for an ethical energy supplier, this is where I got my first taste of coding in SQL and VBA
- I managed and continually developed a complex Pricing Engine that supported pricing for all our customer types, built in an Excel front-end that housed a significant amount of VBA I was also responsible for. I spent a lot of my time developing SQL (using MS SQL Server) to interact with the pricing model and produce reporting and analysis for a range of key stakeholders
- I worked on developing a lot of new products for all the strands of our customer base, and worked with a range of colleagues on these. I learnt how useful proper planning and speccing is, as well as how to manage colleagues' expectations - what's possible, what's realistic, and what's worth it!


## Skills


#### Fast & Enthusiastic Learner

I love learning new things - whether it be practical skills, information or random trivia. As soon as I learn something I want to put it into practice or share the information with someone.
When I worked at Bristol Energy, I went into the role not even knowing how Excel worked properly, but by the end I regularly offered my support to my colleagues with Excel, VBA and SQL (the three tools I spent most of my time with).
Before starting the Makers Academy course, I taught myself some introductory Java.

#### Logical Problem Solver

When encountering a problem - from small error messages to more complex interactions - I always try to approach it as logically as possible, to work out _how_ to solve it before diving into it. By thinking about _why_ something is or isn't working, I'm able to narrow down a larger problem to a much more specific one. This was noted in one of the external reviews I did while a Makers student, where the reviewer said:
>You did a really good job with being able to read the important information in the backtrace and were able to identify where errors were occurring and what kind of error it was, this meant that for the most part you could interpret what the problem was by using that information and you did not try random changes to the code in order to fix the bugs.

## Education

**Bristol University** (September 2013 - June 2016)

- BSc (Hons) Mathematics
- I achieved a First overall
- I particularly focused on Pure Maths (number theory, group theory and set theory were some of my favourite modules)

**A-Levels** (September 2011 - June 2013)
- Maths (A\*), Further Maths (A\*), Chemistry (A\*), German (A)

## Hobbies

**Triathlon**  
I'm currently in training for my first sprint triathlon so you may see me plodding the streets of Bristol or cycling the surrounding area on a bike twice my age.   

**Boardgames**  
I'm a big fan of boardgames as well and have a reasonable collection of modern classics - Azul is the one I recommend most often.
